# API Usage & Documentation

Odyssey has an extensive REST API that gives developers the ability to integrate it into apps of their choosing. The full documentation of this api will be available at: http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/

We highly recommend to use the OpenAPI document to to manage creation of your API clients!

## Usage the API in Other Languages

Currently, there are no existing packages that can be easily downloaded that interface with Odysseyâ€™s API. They are coming soon though! Packages for the following languages are planned for development though:

- Python
- Swift
- Rust
